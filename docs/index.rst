Confidence Intervals for Scikit Learn Random Forests
=====================================================

Random forest algorithms are useful for both classification and regression
problems. This package adds to scikit-learn the ability to calculate confidence
intervals of the predictions generated from scikit-learn
:class:`sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor` and :class:`sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier` objects.

This is an implementation of an algorithm developed by Wager et al. [Wager2014]_
and previously implemented in R (`here <https://github.com/swager/randomForestCI>`_).
