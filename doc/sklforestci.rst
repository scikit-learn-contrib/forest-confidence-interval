Random Forest Confidence Intervals
==================================

This module creates an in-bag and calculates the variance for a scikit-learn
RandomForest regressor or classifier objects. The variance can be used to plot
error bars for RandomForest objects

The inbag is a matrix documenting which sample entered which decision tree

The error bar calculation is based on Wager's (2014) infinite jackknife variance

See the `README <https://github.com/uwescience/sklearn-forest-ci/blob/master/README.md>`_
for more information.
